# MachineLearningProject1AU
Project 1 in collaboration with Teun (https://github.com/T3unp) for Machine Learning, Spring / Semester 1, 2019, the University of Melbourne. 

The objective of this project is to understand how Naive Bayes works. Three datasets ("cmc.csv", "car.csv", and "breast-cancer.csv" available on Kaggle) are used to determine the performance of the classifier. It is also evaluated in terms of its accuracy, information gain, and missing values.
